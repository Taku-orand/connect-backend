# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Answer.create(student_id: 1, question_id: 1, content: "test", like: 0, anonymous: false)
# Question.create(title:"test", content:"test_content", like:0, student_id:1, status: false, anonymous:false)
